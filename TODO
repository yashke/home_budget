accounts history vs. saved transactions comparator
My bank sends me summary of all transactions made on my accounts every month. I also write down all the expenses and incomes to track down non-trivial costs.
The problem is that I'm not 100% sure if my expenses-incomes list contain really all operations I do. And my bank account listings are too detailed and the categories they have assigned are sometimes incorrect or totally not important to me. That's why I want to track all my money through additional app, but I also want to see all the differences to this what happened or just to limit those leakages.

credit card money flow
I'm still not sure what I want to achieve, but I see huge problem with credit card - I write down all credit card expenses, so I feel like I would pay for it now, but I actually have to pay for it 1 month later. I want to know how much money is "pending", will charge my next salary.
